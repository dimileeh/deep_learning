This repository contains projects that I've worked on during the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation on Udacity.

## Project1
First neural network using pure Numpy. Bike sharing predictions.

## Project2
Image classification from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project3
TV scripts generations using Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM.
