This repository contains projects that I've worked on during the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation on Udacity.

## Project 1
First neural network using pure Numpy. Bike sharing predictions.

## Project 2
Image classification from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project 3
TV scripts generation using Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM.

## Project 4
LSTM network for translating sentences from English to French.

## Project 5
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating human faces.
